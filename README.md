# 🌱 **Plant Seedling Classification using CNNs**

In recent times, agriculture has faced the challenge of modernizing 🌾. The extensive manual work required to monitor plant growth is still prevalent 🧑‍🌾. Although there have been several advances in agricultural technology, identifying and classifying plants and weeds remains labor-intensive.  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning 🌐 have the potential to revolutionize this trillion-dollar industry. AI can dramatically reduce the time and effort required to identify plant seedlings. By enhancing efficiency and accuracy, AI could improve crop yields 🌾, allow workers to focus on higher-level agricultural decisions, and support sustainable environmental practices 🌍.

## 🎯 **Objective:**
The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠 to classify plant seedlings into their respective categories 🌱.

## 📊 **Data Description:**
The dataset is provided by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark 🇩🇰. It contains images of unique plants from 12 different species 🌿.

## 🚀 **Project Goal:**
The aim of this project is to create a classifier capable of identifying a plant's species 🌾 from an image 📸.
